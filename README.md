# AI Powered Prompt based  Data-Analyzer

Data Analyzer is an interactive Streamlit-based tool that uses Google Gemini (Gemini 1.5) to analyze your data using natural language — just upload a CSV, ask questions, and get instant visualizations or answers.

💡 Why Use This?
This project is designed to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical users:

✅ No coding required — users can interact with data using simple questions.
✅ AI-generated visualizations and filters — powered by Gemini and LangChain.
✅ Supports multiple chart libraries — matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.
✅ Auto encoding detection — even messy CSV files are handled gracefully.
✅ PDF export — download a full summary of your analysis.

Whether you're a data analyst, student, educator, or business user, this app makes data interaction more human and accessible.
